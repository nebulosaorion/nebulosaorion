## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

Hello! My name is **Miriã Evangelista**, I’m 29 years old and currently an undergraduate student in **Computer Engineering**.

I have hands-on experience with **Python** and **ROS** (Robot Operating System), and I’m currently taking a **Front-End Development course** to strengthen my skill set and obtain certification.

I’m an active member of the robotics team **FBOT**, contributing to software development. In addition, I participate in two academic projects:

- 🎓 **Scholarship holder** in the **Intelligent Robot** project, focused on autonomous robotics and decision-making systems.
- 🤝 **Volunteer** in the project **Simultaneous Sign Language Interpretation using AI**, which aims to improve accessibility with artificial intelligence.

I’m passionate about combining **technology, accessibility, and automation** to develop impactful solutions.
